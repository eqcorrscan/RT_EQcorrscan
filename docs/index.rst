Welcome to RT-EQcorrscan's documentation!
=========================================

RT-EQcorrscan is a near real-time implementation of the matched-filter methods in
EQcorrscan. Matched-filters provide an effective way of detecting more earthquakes
in situations where classic energy-based detectors struggle, such as during high-rate
sequences, or when noise-levels are elevated. This package is designed to enable
"densification" of earthquake catalogues in near-real-time. The hope is that this will
provide useful information towards understanding earthquake sources and how earthquake sequences
develop in a timely manor.

Feel free to try out the package, modify the code as you see fit, and generally play around.
If you have questions/comments or find bugs then please file an issue on the projects
